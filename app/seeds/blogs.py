The reduction of sugar, high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors, artificial sweeteners, and over dependence on refined grains will decrease the risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, and premature death. Try eating more foods that is whole, and unprocessed. Food should be recognizable in their natural state as something that was alive or has come out of the ground. Eat a diet high in natural fats.

Fasting does not make you tired in fact you’ll have increased energy. Fasting does not burn muscle. Fasting unleashes anti-aging properties of growth hormone and slows aging. Fasting boost brain power and improves heart health. All of these benefits are achieved without drugs, supplements, or any financial cost.

This type of fasting I practice on a daily basis. Fasting can range from twelve hours to three months. you can fast once a month or once a week or once a year. For most people I would recommend a 16:8 intermittent fasting eating window. The fact that you sleep through the. majority of your fast makes it easier than longer fasting periods.;Circadian Rhythms:;Circadian rhythms are repetitive, predictable, cyclical changes, in behaviors and over twenty-four hours. Our hormones follow a circadian rhythm. These hormones affect weight gain, and ghrelin, which controls hunger leading to impractical eating and weight gain.

Meals should be eaten in a twelve hour period, between 8am and 8pm.;Extended Fasting:;Extended fasting usually last more than 42 hours. The longest fast I have completed was a 72 hour fast ( 3 days). Part of my experience was the first 2 days are usually difficult. however once I pushed past the second day It became a lot easier, I actually felt as if I could go on for a couple more days. I still continued to exercise which you can, there’s actually a burst of energy you experience while fasting. The key is to stay hydrated.;I would suggest making fasting part of your healthy life style. Some suggestions for fasting success, always remember why you’re doing it, and keep your goals in mind.  It may be for weight loss, for health or mental clarity and strength. Always readjust your strategy based on your results. Maybe shorter fast  works best for you or maybe longer or maybe alternate day faster works best. Listen to your body it never lies.;Fasting Tips:;Stayed hydrated, drink plenty of fluids;Stay busy;Ride the wave, hunger comes in waves drink hot tea or coffee. often times your hunger will pass.;Don’t tell people you are fasting, most people will try to discourage you.;Give yourself a month your body will get used to it, the first couple of times will be difficult, don’t get discouraged.;Follow a nutritious diet on non fasting days.;Don’t binge after fasting, eat normally.
