This type of fasting I practice on a daily basis. Fasting can range from twelve hours to three months. you can fast once a month or once a week or once a year. For most people I would recommend a 16:8 intermittent fasting eating window. The fact that you sleep through the. majority of your fast makes it easier than longer fasting periods.;Circadian Rhythms:;Circadian rhythms are repetitive, predictable, cyclical changes, in behaviors and over twenty-four hours. Our hormones follow a circadian rhythm. These hormones affect weight gain, and ghrelin, which controls hunger leading to impractical eating and weight gain.

Meals should be eaten in a twelve hour period, between 8am and 8pm.;Extended Fasting:;Extended fasting usually last more than 42 hours. The longest fast I have completed was a 72 hour fast ( 3 days). Part of my experience was the first 2 days are usually difficult. however once I pushed past the second day It became a lot easier, I actually felt as if I could go on for a couple more days.

It may be for weight loss, for health or mental clarity and strength. Always readjust your strategy based on your results. Maybe shorter fast  works best for you or maybe longer or maybe alternate day faster works best. Listen to your body it never lies.;Fasting Tips:;Stayed hydrated, drink plenty of fluids;Stay busy;Ride the wave, hunger comes in waves drink hot tea or coffee. often times your hunger will pass.;Don’t tell people you are fasting, most people will try to discourage you.;Give yourself a month your body will get used to it, the first couple of times will be difficult, don’t get discouraged.;Follow a nutritious diet on non fasting days.;Don’t binge after fasting, eat normally. Plan ahead. Try to have food prepared before the fast begins.;Fit fasting into your own life. don’t limit yourself socially because your’e fasting.
